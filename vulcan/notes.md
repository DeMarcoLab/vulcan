milled calibration patterns to get resolution / depth relationship
encoutered issues

issues:
charging
tearing of surface (gold?) green effect?
resolution vs dose vs depth calibration
    - increase depth = passes ++, time ++
milling rectangle and bitmap behave differently (even for flat bitmap)
unable to replicate previous results - lots of moving parts

Tested the effects of pixel size, pitch / overlap, and sought to understand depth / passes. Milled a 800x400 focusing lens that matched expected depth (5um)

### 7 October


parallel and serial milling produce different outcomes
- why?
